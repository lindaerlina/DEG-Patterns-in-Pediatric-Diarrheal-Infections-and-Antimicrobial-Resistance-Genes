# DEG-Patterns-in-Pediatric-Diarrheal-Infections-and-Antimicrobial-Resistance-Genes
Pediatric diarrhea is often associated with dysbiosis and pathogenic microorganisms, necessitating further molecular investigation. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis offers potential insights into biomarkers for the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of diarrhea and antibiotic resistance in children.<img width="468" height="55" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c1d97b7-f5fb-4e5a-ae37-ab5f5b1245e4" />
