# DEG-Patterns-in-Pediatric-Diarrheal-Infections-and-Antimicrobial-Resistance-Genes
Pediatric diarrhea is often associated with dysbiosis and pathogenic microorganisms, necessitating further molecular investigation. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis may provide insights into biomarkers of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlying diarrhea and antibiotic resistance in children.

The study aims to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance by analyzing publicly available transcriptomic datasets (GSE69529 and GSE54070) in children with diarrhea.

Methods Overview: DEG analysis was performed using GEO2R on GSE69529 and GSE54070 datasets. Multiple machine learning models (SVM, RF, NN, LR, XGBoost) were applied via Orange 3.10.2 for cross-validation. Cytoscape and databases such as STRINGdb, IntAct, and CTD were utilized for protein interaction and upstream regulatory analysis.
